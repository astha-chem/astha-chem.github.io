		A Device to Measure Zeta Potential at High Ionic Strength</b> <br />
		<br/>
		We have developed a device to measure zeta potential up to saturated 
		salt conditions, applicable to polymeric particles, oil emulsions and 
		biological cells. Our experiments and Monte-Carlo simulations provide 
		insight into the angstrom scale electrical double layer close to 
		saturated salt conditions. We are currently working on characterizing 
		concentration-gradient driven,

		diffusiophoresis</a> flows at high ionic strength, where they are often 
		thought to be negligible but our measurements have clearly indicated to 
		the contrary.

		Material exchange in mineral replacement reactions</b><br />
		<br/>
		Mineral replacement reactions such as
		<a href="http://geology.com/stories/13/petrified-wood/">petrification of 
		wood</a> are driven by fluid flows which result in porosity in the 
		starting mineral. We are trying to understand and control these flows to 
		control the porosity generated, in collaboration with Halliburton. A 
		recent poster on this topic can be accessed

		Zeta potential non-uniformity of active microparticles</b><br />
		<br/>
		We measured the zeta potential of each end of active 
		platinum/polystyrene Janus particles using video microscopy rotational 
		electrophoresis, in order to estimate the electrostatic contribution to 
		their interaction with a wall. Currently we are using microfluidics to 
		understand their behavior in hydrogen peroxide fuel gradients. Our paper 
		on this subject can be found
